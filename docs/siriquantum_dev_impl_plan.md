# SiriQuantum Development and Implementation Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive development and implementation plan for the SiriQuantum trading system. The system adapts the low-latency trading architecture from the "Building Low-Latency Applications with C++" reference implementation to work with external exchanges (Zerodha and Binance) while preserving the core strategy components.

The system supports:
- Both paper trading (for development/testing) and live trading (for real market participation)
- Configuration-based switching between modes without code changes
- Core strategy implementations: Liquidity Taker and Market Maker
- Multi-exchange support through exchange-specific adapters
- Full order book reconstruction from limited depth data
- Comprehensive risk management system

## 2. Architecture Overview

The SiriQuantum trading system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns and well-defined interfaces between components.

                                                                                                      │
┌─────────────────┐      ┌───────────────┐      ┌───────────────┐      ┌───────────────┐      ┌───────▼───────┐
│ Exchange        │      │ REST/WebSocket│      │ Order Gateway │      │ ClientRequest │      │ Trading       │
│ REST/WS API     │◀────▶│ Client        │◀────▶│ Adapter       │◀────▶│ Queue         │◀────▶│ Strategies    │
└─────────────────┘      └───────────────┘      └───────────────┘      └───────────────┘      └───────────────┘
```

The system consists of these major components:

1. **Market Data Adapter**: Connects to exchange WebSocket APIs, processes market data, and converts it to a standardized internal format.

2. **Order Book**: Maintains a full limit order book representation from the exchange market data, which may provide limited depth information.

3. **Market Data Queue**: A lock-free queue that connects the market data adapter to the trade engine.

4. **Trade Engine**: Core component responsible for processing market updates, routing them to strategies, and managing the overall trading flow.

5. **Feature Engine**: Calculates trading signals and metrics from market data for use by strategies.

6. **Strategies**:
   - **Liquidity Taker**: Detects directional opportunities and executes aggressive orders
   - **Market Maker**: Provides liquidity by placing bid/ask orders with specified spread

7. **Order Manager**: Manages order lifecycle, tracks active orders, and handles cancellations/modifications.

8. **Risk Manager**: Enforces position and risk limits, prevents excessive exposure.

9. **Position Keeper**: Tracks current positions across instruments.

10. **Order Gateway Adapter**: Connects to exchange REST/WebSocket APIs for order placement and management.

11. **Client Request/Response Queues**: Lock-free queues for passing order operations between components.

### 2.3 Trading Modes

The system supports two trading modes:

1. **Paper Trading**:

## 6. Developer Guidelines

### 6.1 Namespace Handling

The codebase uses both the `Exchange` namespace and `Adapter::Zerodha` namespace. To avoid namespace conflicts and improve code clarity:

```cpp
// Define at the top of your header files:
namespace ExchangeNS = ::Exchange;

// For Exchange types
ExchangeNS::MEMarketUpdate* update = /* ... */;
ExchangeNS::MarketUpdateType::ADD

// For Common types
Common::TickerId ticker_id;
Common::Side::BUY

// For Zerodha types
Adapter::Zerodha::MarketUpdate market_update;
```

Best practices:
1. **Never** use a blanket `using namespace` for the entire Exchange namespace
2. **Always** use the `ExchangeNS` alias for Exchange types
3. **Prefer** fully qualified names for types from other namespaces
4. **Be consistent** with namespace usage across related files

### 6.2 Logging System

The codebase uses a custom lock-free, high-performance logging system:

```cpp
// Format string with placeholders
logger_->log("%:% %() % Starting operation for ticker %\n", 
             __FILE__, __LINE__, __FUNCTION__, 
             Common::getCurrentTimeStr(&time_str), ticker_id);
```

Key points:
1. Uses `%` as the placeholder character for substitutions
2. Order of parameters is important - they're substituted sequentially
3. Always include `\n` at the end of log messages
4. Include file, line, function context in important logs
5. Include timestamp in important logs using `Common::getCurrentTimeStr(&time_str)`
6. The logger is thread-safe and lock-free

### 6.3 Lock-Free Queue (LFQueue)

The system uses lock-free queues extensively for inter-thread communication:

```cpp
// Reading from a queue
while (auto* update = queue_->getNextToRead()) {
    // Process update
    process_update(update);
    
    // Important: update the read index AFTER processing
    queue_->updateReadIndex();
}

// Writing to a queue
auto* item = queue_->getNextToWriteTo();
if (item) {
    // Fill the item with data
    item->field1 = value1;
    item->field2 = value2;
    
    // Important: update the write index AFTER filling
    queue_->updateWriteIndex();
}
```

Key points:
1. Always update read/write indices after processing/filling items
2. Check for nullptr returns from getNextToRead/getNextToWriteTo
3. LFQueue assumes a single reader and single writer pattern
4. Never modify items after updating the write index
5. Never access items after updating the read index

### 6.4 Memory Pool Management

The order book implementation uses a memory pool for efficient allocation of market update objects:

```cpp
// Create a memory pool
Common::MemPool<ExchangeNS::MEMarketUpdate> update_pool_(POOL_SIZE);

// Allocate an object from the pool
auto* event = update_pool_.allocate();
if (event) {
    // Initialize the object
    event->type_ = ExchangeNS::MarketUpdateType::ADD;
    event->ticker_id_ = ticker_id_;
    // ...
}

// Objects are automatically returned to the pool when no longer referenced
```

Key points:
1. Memory pools preallocate a fixed number of objects
2. If a pool is exhausted, `.allocate()` will assert failure
3. Always size your pools appropriately for the expected load
4. Objects from pools should be short-lived to prevent pool exhaustion
5. Pools are not thread-safe; use them within a single thread

### 6.5 Type Conversion and Casting

The codebase deals with various numeric types that sometimes need explicit casting:

```cpp
// Convert long int to uint64_t (for timestamps)
uint64_t timestamp = static_cast<uint64_t>(Common::getCurrentNanos());

// Convert double to integer with scaling (for price values)
uint64_t price_bits = static_cast<uint64_t>(price * 100.0);

// Convert ticker_id to 64-bit value for bit operations
uint64_t id_bits = static_cast<uint64_t>(ticker_id) << 48;
```

Best practices:
1. Always use explicit `static_cast<>` to make conversions clear
2. Be aware of narrowing conversions and handle them explicitly
3. Use `static_cast<size_t>` for loop counters to prevent sign comparison warnings
4. Use appropriate types for bitwise operations (usually uint64_t)
5. Be careful with floating-point to integer conversions, especially for prices

### 6.6 Event Generation

When generating market events:

1. Always set all fields of the event object:
   - `type_` - Market update type (ADD, MODIFY, CANCEL, TRADE)
   - `ticker_id_` - Internal ticker ID
   - `side_` - Buy or sell side
   - `price_` - Price in internal format
   - `qty_` - Quantity
   - `order_id_` - Synthetic order ID for tracking
   
2. Be consistent with price conversions (Zerodha uses paise, we use rupees)
3. Generate proper synthetic order IDs that remain consistent
4. Handle special cases like trades separately

Market update events allocated from the memory pool should:
1. Be added to the events vector returned to the adapter
2. Never be stored in the order book itself
3. Never be modified after adding to the events vector
4. Never be explicitly deleted or freed

## 7. Configuration Reference

### 7.1 Environment Variables

The system uses these environment variables for Zerodha configuration:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `ZKITE_API_KEY` | Zerodha API key | `abcdefghijklmnopqr` |
| `ZKITE_API_SECRET` | Zerodha API secret | `yourapisecrethere` |
| `ZKITE_USER_ID` | Zerodha user ID | `AB1234` |
| `ZKITE_PWD` | Zerodha password | `yourpassword` |
| `ZKITE_TOTP_SECRET` | TOTP secret for two-factor authentication | `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP` |
| `ZKITE_INSTRUMENTS_CACHE_DIR` | Directory to cache instrument data | `/home/user/.cache/zerodha` |
| `ZKITE_ACCESS_TOKEN_PATH` | Path to store access token | `/home/user/.cache/kite_token.json` |
| `ZKITE_USE_FUTURES_FOR_INDICES` | Whether to use futures for index symbols (1/0) | `1` |
| `ZKITE_DEFAULT_EXCHANGE` | Default exchange if not specified in symbol | `NSE` |
| `ZKITE_SYMBOL_MAP` | JSON mapping of symbol aliases to actual symbols | `{"NIFTY":"NIFTY 50"}` |
| `ZKITE_TEST_SYMBOLS` | JSON list of symbols to subscribe in test mode | `["NSE:RELIANCE"]` |

These variables can be loaded from a .env file:
```cpp
// Load environment variables from .env file
Adapter::Zerodha::ZerodhaAuthenticator::load_env_file("/home/praveen/om/siriquantum/.env");
```

### 7.2 trading.json Configuration

The `trading.json` file contains exchange credentials, trading system configuration, and instrument definitions:

```json
{
  "trading_mode": "PAPER",  // "PAPER" or "LIVE"
  "exchange": "ZERODHA",
  "zerodha": {
    "api_credentials": {

## 11. Zerodha Order Gateway Adapter Implementation

### 11.1 Overview

The Zerodha Order Gateway Adapter is a component that handles order submission, tracking, and management between the SiriQuantum trading system and the Zerodha trading platform. It serves as the bridge between internal trading strategies and Zerodha's order placement API.

The adapter supports two operational modes:
- **Paper Trading Mode**: Simulates order execution locally with configurable parameters
- **Live Trading Mode**: Sends real orders to Zerodha's trading platform via their API

### 11.2 Architecture

#### 11.2.1 Key Classes

- **ZerodhaOrderGatewayAdapter**: Main adapter class that processes order requests and generates responses
- **ZerodhaOrderConfig**: Configuration structure for the adapter
- **ZerodhaOrder**: Internal representation of an order with Zerodha-specific attributes

#### 11.2.2 Data Flow

1. Trading strategies (e.g., Liquidity Taker, Market Maker) generate order requests based on market data analysis
2. Order requests are placed in the ClientRequestLFQueue (lock-free queue)
3. The order gateway adapter's main thread continually monitors this queue
4. When a request is detected, it is processed according to the trading mode:
   - Paper Trading: Simulated locally with configurable parameters
   - Live Trading: Sent to Zerodha via API calls
5. Responses (acceptances, fills, cancellations) are placed in the ClientResponseLFQueue
6. Trading strategies consume these responses to update their state and make further decisions

### 11.3 Implementation Details

#### 11.3.1 Initialization

The adapter is initialized with the following parameters:
- Client ID: Unique identifier for the trading client
- Request Queue: Lock-free queue for incoming order requests
- Response Queue: Lock-free queue for outgoing order responses
- API Credentials: Zerodha API key and secret
- Configuration: Parameters for paper trading simulation and operation

#### 11.3.2 Order Processing

##### Request Types

The adapter handles these order request types:
- **NEW**: Place a new order (market, limit)
- **CANCEL**: Cancel an existing order

##### Response Types

The adapter generates these response types:
- **ACCEPTED**: Order has been accepted (but not yet executed)
- **FILLED**: Order has been executed (fully or partially)
- **CANCELED**: Order has been successfully canceled
- **CANCEL_REJECTED**: Order cancellation was rejected

#### 11.3.3 Paper Trading Mode

In paper trading mode, the adapter simulates order execution with these configurable parameters:

1. **Fill Probability**: Likelihood of an order being filled (0.0-1.0)
2. **Latency Range**: Min/max simulated processing time (in milliseconds)
3. **Slippage Factor**: Simulated price movement during execution
4. **Slippage Model**: Distribution model for price movement (FIXED, NORMAL, PARETO)

The paper trading simulation follows this process:
1. Order is immediately ACCEPTED
2. A separate thread simulates order execution with random latency
3. Based on fill probability, the order is either FILLED or CANCELED
4. For filled orders, a price slippage is applied based on the configured model
5. The response is placed in the response queue

#### 11.3.4 Live Trading Mode

In live trading mode, the adapter communicates with Zerodha's API:

1. Authenticates using the ZerodhaAuthenticator component
2. Converts internal order format to Zerodha's API format
3. Sends HTTP requests to Zerodha's order API endpoints
4. Polls for order status updates at configurable intervals
5. Processes status updates and generates appropriate responses

### 11.4 Configuration

The adapter supports these configuration options:

```cpp
struct ZerodhaOrderConfig {
    bool is_paper_trading = false;               // Whether to use paper trading mode
    std::string api_key;                         // Zerodha API key
    std::string api_secret;                      // Zerodha API secret
    std::string totp_secret;                     // TOTP secret for 2FA
    int reconnect_interval_ms = 1000;            // Interval to retry connection on failure
    int order_status_poll_interval_ms = 2000;    // Interval to poll order status updates
    std::string default_exchange = "NSE";        // Default exchange if not specified
    std::string default_product = "CNC";         // Default product type (CNC, MIS, NRML)
    
    // Paper trading simulation parameters
    double fill_probability = 0.9;               // Probability of order execution
    double min_latency_ms = 10.0;                // Minimum simulated latency
    double max_latency_ms = 50.0;                // Maximum simulated latency
    double slippage_factor = 0.0005;             // Slippage factor (0.05%)
    std::string slippage_model = "NORMAL";       // Slippage model: FIXED, NORMAL, PARETO
};
```

### 11.5 Strategy Integration

#### How Strategies Interact with the Order Gateway

Trading strategies interact with the order gateway adapter through the ClientRequestLFQueue and ClientResponseLFQueue:

1. Strategies analyze market data to make trading decisions
2. When a decision is made, a strategy creates an order request:
   ```cpp
   Exchange::MEClientRequest request;
   request.type_ = Exchange::ClientRequestType::NEW;
   request.client_id_ = client_id_;
   request.ticker_id_ = ticker_id;
   request.order_id_ = generateOrderId();
   request.side_ = side;
   request.price_ = price;  // 0 for market orders
   request.qty_ = quantity;
   ```

3. The strategy places this request in the client_requests queue:
   ```cpp
   auto next_write = client_requests_->getNextToWriteTo();
   *next_write = request;
   client_requests_->updateWriteIndex();
   ```

4. The order gateway processes the request and generates responses in the client_responses queue
5. Strategies monitor this queue for responses related to their orders:
   ```cpp
   for (auto response = client_responses_->getNextToRead(); 
        response; 
        response = client_responses_->getNextToRead()) {
       
       if (response->client_id_ == client_id_) {
           // Process the response based on its type
           switch (response->type_) {
               case Exchange::ClientResponseType::ACCEPTED:
                   // Update strategy state for accepted order
                   break;
               case Exchange::ClientResponseType::FILLED:
                   // Update strategy state for filled order
                   // Update position, P&L, etc.
                   break;
               // Handle other response types...
           }
       }
       
       client_responses_->updateReadIndex();
   }
   ```

#### Strategy-Specific Considerations

Different strategies may use the order gateway differently:

1. **Liquidity Taker Strategy**:
   - Typically uses market orders for immediate execution
   - May use aggressive limit orders when price targets are critical
   - Monitors fill rates and execution quality

2. **Market Maker Strategy**:
   - Places passive limit orders on both sides of the market
   - Frequently cancels and replaces orders as market conditions change
   - Monitors order queue position and fill rates

#### Testing Strategy Integration

When testing the integration between strategies and the order gateway:

1. **Unit Testing**: Test each component in isolation
   - For order gateway: Mock strategy order placement (as in our current test)
   - For strategies: Mock order gateway responses

2. **Integration Testing**: Test components working together
   - Create test scenarios with market data inputs
   - Verify strategy decisions lead to expected order placement
   - Verify order responses properly update strategy state

3. **System Testing**: Test the complete system
   - Run with real or simulated market data
   - Verify end-to-end operation from market data to order execution
   - Monitor performance, latency, and error handling

### 11.6 Current Implementation Status

The current implementation of the Zerodha Order Gateway Adapter includes:

1. **Core Functionality**:
   - Complete order request/response handling
   - Support for market and limit orders
   - Support for order cancellation

2. **Paper Trading Mode**:
   - Fully implemented with configurable parameters
   - Simulated latency, fills, and slippage
   - Order tracking and status management

3. **Live Trading Mode**:
   - Zerodha API integration
   - Authentication handling
   - Order status polling

4. **Testing**:
   - Standalone test program for validating functionality
   - Support for both paper and live testing modes
   
The adapter is now ready for integration with trading strategies, with both paper trading and live trading capabilities fully operational.

## 12. Critical Implementation Details and Lessons Learned

### 12.1 WebSocket Connection Initialization Order

During implementation of the Zerodha adapters, we encountered an important timing issue related to component initialization order. The sequence in which components are created and started has a significant impact on system stability, particularly with WebSocket connections.

#### 12.1.1 Issue: Liquidity Taker Test Stalling

The `zerodha_liquidity_taker_test` initially stalled during execution despite successful authentication. The test would hang after initializing the authenticator and not progress to establishing the WebSocket connection.

Investigation revealed:
1. The market data test (which worked correctly) had a simpler initialization sequence
2. The liquidity taker test was creating multiple components including strategy objects before initializing the WebSocket connection
3. These additional components were potentially interfering with the WebSocket connection process

#### 12.1.2 Root Cause Analysis

The root cause was identified as a timing issue in component initialization:
1. In the working market data test:
   - Create market data adapter
   - Subscribe to symbols 
   - Start the adapter (which initiates WebSocket connection)
   - Wait for connection
   - Only then proceed with further operations

2. In the problematic liquidity taker test:
   - Create market data adapter
   - Create order gateway
   - Create multiple other components (order book, trade engine, liquidity taker, etc.)
   - Subscribe to symbols
   - Start the adapter
   - Check connection status

This difference in initialization order was causing the WebSocket connection to stall.

#### 12.1.3 Solution

The solution involved modifying the initialization sequence in the liquidity taker test:

1. Create market data adapter first
2. Subscribe to symbols
3. Start the adapter
4. Wait explicitly for WebSocket connection to be established
5. Only after confirmed connection, create and initialize other components
6. Start order gateway and other components last

This approach ensures that the WebSocket connection is established without interference from other components.

#### 12.1.4 Key Implementation Guidelines

Based on this experience, we've established these critical guidelines for all exchange adapter implementations:

1. **Connection Establishment Priority**: WebSocket connections should be established before initializing other components
2. **Component Initialization Order**:
   - Market data adapter should be created first
   - Symbol subscriptions should be configured before starting the adapter
   - WebSocket connection should be explicitly verified before proceeding
   - Other components (strategies, order gateways, etc.) should be initialized only after connection is confirmed
3. **Connection Verification**: Always implement explicit verification of connection status with timeouts
4. **Connection Handling**: Include reconnection logic with appropriate backoff for production systems

These guidelines ensure robust initialization and connection handling for all exchange integrations.

### 12.2 WebSocket Client Implementation

The WebSocket client implementation for Zerodha uses Boost.Beast for secure WebSocket communication. Key considerations in the implementation include:

1. **Heartbeat Handling**: The Zerodha WebSocket sends 1-byte heartbeat messages periodically
2. **Reconnection Strategy**: Exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
3. **Session Management**: Re-subscription to symbols after reconnection
4. **Thread Safety**: Proper synchronization for WebSocket operations

The WebSocket client runs in its own thread and uses a message-based architecture for market data updates, which are then converted to the internal market update format by the adapter.
