                                                                                                      │
┌─────────────────┐      ┌───────────────┐      ┌───────────────┐      ┌───────────────┐      ┌───────▼───────┐
│ Exchange        │      │ REST/WebSocket│      │ Order Gateway │      │ ClientRequest │      │ Trading       │
│ REST/WS API     │◀────▶│ Client        │◀────▶│ Adapter       │◀────▶│ Queue         │◀────▶│ Strategies    │
└─────────────────┘      └───────────────┘      └───────────────┘      └───────────────┘      └───────────────┘
```

The system consists of these major components:

1. **Market Data Adapter**: Connects to exchange WebSocket APIs, processes market data, and converts it to a standardized internal format.

2. **Order Book**: Maintains a full limit order book representation from the exchange market data, which may provide limited depth information.

3. **Market Data Queue**: A lock-free queue that connects the market data adapter to the trade engine.

4. **Trade Engine**: Core component responsible for processing market updates, routing them to strategies, and managing the overall trading flow.

5. **Feature Engine**: Calculates trading signals and metrics from market data for use by strategies.

6. **Strategies**:
   - **Liquidity Taker**: Detects directional opportunities and executes aggressive orders
   - **Market Maker**: Provides liquidity by placing bid/ask orders with specified spread

7. **Order Manager**: Manages order lifecycle, tracks active orders, and handles cancellations/modifications.

8. **Risk Manager**: Enforces position and risk limits, prevents excessive exposure.

9. **Position Keeper**: Tracks current positions across instruments.

10. **Order Gateway Adapter**: Connects to exchange REST/WebSocket APIs for order placement and management.

11. **Client Request/Response Queues**: Lock-free queues for passing order operations between components.

### 2.3 Trading Modes

The system supports two trading modes:

1. **Paper Trading**:

## 6. Developer Guidelines

### 6.1 Namespace Handling

The codebase uses both the `Exchange` namespace and `Adapter::Zerodha` namespace. To avoid namespace conflicts and improve code clarity:

```cpp
// Define at the top of your header files:
namespace ExchangeNS = ::Exchange;

// For Exchange types
ExchangeNS::MEMarketUpdate* update = /* ... */;
ExchangeNS::MarketUpdateType::ADD

// For Common types
Common::TickerId ticker_id;
Common::Side::BUY

// For Zerodha types
Adapter::Zerodha::MarketUpdate market_update;
```

Best practices:
1. **Never** use a blanket `using namespace` for the entire Exchange namespace
2. **Always** use the `ExchangeNS` alias for Exchange types
3. **Prefer** fully qualified names for types from other namespaces
4. **Be consistent** with namespace usage across related files

### 6.2 Logging System

The codebase uses a custom lock-free, high-performance logging system:

```cpp
// Format string with placeholders
logger_->log("%:% %() % Starting operation for ticker %\n", 
             __FILE__, __LINE__, __FUNCTION__, 
             Common::getCurrentTimeStr(&time_str), ticker_id);
```

Key points:
1. Uses `%` as the placeholder character for substitutions
2. Order of parameters is important - they're substituted sequentially
3. Always include `\n` at the end of log messages
4. Include file, line, function context in important logs
5. Include timestamp in important logs using `Common::getCurrentTimeStr(&time_str)`
6. The logger is thread-safe and lock-free

### 6.3 Lock-Free Queue (LFQueue)

The system uses lock-free queues extensively for inter-thread communication:

```cpp
// Reading from a queue
while (auto* update = queue_->getNextToRead()) {
    // Process update
    process_update(update);
    
    // Important: update the read index AFTER processing
    queue_->updateReadIndex();
}

// Writing to a queue
auto* item = queue_->getNextToWriteTo();
if (item) {
    // Fill the item with data
    item->field1 = value1;
    item->field2 = value2;
    
    // Important: update the write index AFTER filling
    queue_->updateWriteIndex();
}
```

Key points:
1. Always update read/write indices after processing/filling items
2. Check for nullptr returns from getNextToRead/getNextToWriteTo
3. LFQueue assumes a single reader and single writer pattern
4. Never modify items after updating the write index
5. Never access items after updating the read index

### 6.4 Memory Pool Management

The order book implementation uses a memory pool for efficient allocation of market update objects:

```cpp
// Create a memory pool
Common::MemPool<ExchangeNS::MEMarketUpdate> update_pool_(POOL_SIZE);

// Allocate an object from the pool
auto* event = update_pool_.allocate();
if (event) {
    // Initialize the object
    event->type_ = ExchangeNS::MarketUpdateType::ADD;
    event->ticker_id_ = ticker_id_;
    // ...
}

// Objects are automatically returned to the pool when no longer referenced
```

Key points:
1. Memory pools preallocate a fixed number of objects
2. If a pool is exhausted, `.allocate()` will assert failure
3. Always size your pools appropriately for the expected load
4. Objects from pools should be short-lived to prevent pool exhaustion
5. Pools are not thread-safe; use them within a single thread

### 6.5 Type Conversion and Casting

The codebase deals with various numeric types that sometimes need explicit casting:

```cpp
// Convert long int to uint64_t (for timestamps)
uint64_t timestamp = static_cast<uint64_t>(Common::getCurrentNanos());

// Convert double to integer with scaling (for price values)
uint64_t price_bits = static_cast<uint64_t>(price * 100.0);

// Convert ticker_id to 64-bit value for bit operations
uint64_t id_bits = static_cast<uint64_t>(ticker_id) << 48;
```

Best practices:
1. Always use explicit `static_cast<>` to make conversions clear
2. Be aware of narrowing conversions and handle them explicitly
3. Use `static_cast<size_t>` for loop counters to prevent sign comparison warnings
4. Use appropriate types for bitwise operations (usually uint64_t)
5. Be careful with floating-point to integer conversions, especially for prices

### 6.6 Event Generation

When generating market events:

1. Always set all fields of the event object:
   - `type_` - Market update type (ADD, MODIFY, CANCEL, TRADE)
   - `ticker_id_` - Internal ticker ID
   - `side_` - Buy or sell side
   - `price_` - Price in internal format
   - `qty_` - Quantity
   - `order_id_` - Synthetic order ID for tracking
   
2. Be consistent with price conversions (Zerodha uses paise, we use rupees)
3. Generate proper synthetic order IDs that remain consistent
4. Handle special cases like trades separately

Market update events allocated from the memory pool should:
1. Be added to the events vector returned to the adapter
2. Never be stored in the order book itself
3. Never be modified after adding to the events vector
4. Never be explicitly deleted or freed

## 7. Configuration Reference

### 7.1 Environment Variables

The system uses these environment variables for Zerodha configuration:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `ZKITE_API_KEY` | Zerodha API key | `abcdefghijklmnopqr` |
| `ZKITE_API_SECRET` | Zerodha API secret | `yourapisecrethere` |
| `ZKITE_USER_ID` | Zerodha user ID | `AB1234` |
| `ZKITE_PWD` | Zerodha password | `yourpassword` |
| `ZKITE_TOTP_SECRET` | TOTP secret for two-factor authentication | `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP` |
| `ZKITE_INSTRUMENTS_CACHE_DIR` | Directory to cache instrument data | `/home/user/.cache/zerodha` |
| `ZKITE_ACCESS_TOKEN_PATH` | Path to store access token | `/home/user/.cache/kite_token.json` |
| `ZKITE_USE_FUTURES_FOR_INDICES` | Whether to use futures for index symbols (1/0) | `1` |
| `ZKITE_DEFAULT_EXCHANGE` | Default exchange if not specified in symbol | `NSE` |
| `ZKITE_SYMBOL_MAP` | JSON mapping of symbol aliases to actual symbols | `{"NIFTY":"NIFTY 50"}` |
| `ZKITE_TEST_SYMBOLS` | JSON list of symbols to subscribe in test mode | `["NSE:RELIANCE"]` |

These variables can be loaded from a .env file:
```cpp
// Load environment variables from .env file
Adapter::Zerodha::ZerodhaAuthenticator::load_env_file("/home/praveen/om/siriquantum/.env");
```

### 7.2 trading.json Configuration

The `trading.json` file contains exchange credentials, trading system configuration, and instrument definitions:

```json
{
  "trading_mode": "PAPER",  // "PAPER" or "LIVE"
  "exchange": "ZERODHA",
  "zerodha": {
    "api_credentials": {
